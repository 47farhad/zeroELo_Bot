No longer contains a makefile, as I can't make one that will work for everyone with CMake.
So please compile these yourself. CMakeLists.txt is still provided.
Will create ChessProject.exe, which you can run.

Please keep clutter out of the repo. Keep the structure according to the main branch.
You will need to use a .gitignore file for this.
Preferably should containt a src folder with all the source code, a compiled exe, a CMakeLists.txt and a readme.md.
